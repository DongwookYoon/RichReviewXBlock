# Webfinger

Webfinger and host-meta client library for Node.js.

It supports:

* XRD documents
* JRD documents
* host-meta
* host-meta.json
* http and https
* RFC 6415 and the upcoming Webfinger RFC (up to draft 09)

## API

### webfinger(address, callback)

Gets link data for the address `address` and returns it to function `callback`.

`callback` should take two arguments: `err` for an error, and `jrd`
for a JRD representation of the Webfinger data.

Note that the data is returned in JRD format even if it's in XRD
format on the server.

This method will first try the `/.well-known/webfinger` endpoint; if
that doesn't work it will fall back to RFC 6415 discovery.

### webfinger(address, rel, callback)

As above, but passes the `rel` parameter to the
`/.well-known/webfinger` endpoint if it's truthy.

This is mostly advisory. Some servers will send all links back
anyways; others don't support the webfinger endpoint, so when we
fallback to RFC 6415 everything is returned.

Even if you pass a `rel` argument, you should still filter the
results. (But future versions of this library may do it for you.)

### webfinger(address, rel, options, callback)

As above, but you can use the `options` object to control
behaviour. Currently, the options are:

* `httpsOnly`: boolean flag, default `false` for whether to only use
  HTTPS for communicating with the server. When this is set, it won't
  use Webfinger, host-meta or LRDD endpoints that aren't HTTPS, and won't
  follow redirect requests to HTTP endpoints.

### hostmeta(address, callback)

Gets link data for the host at `address` and returns it to function `callback`.

`callback` works just like with `webfinger()`.

### hostmeta(address, options, callback)

As above, but you can use the `options` object to control
behaviour. Currently, the options are:

* `httpsOnly`: boolean flag, default `false`, for whether to only use
  HTTPS for communicating with the server. When this is set, it won't
  use host-meta or host-meta.json endpoints that aren't HTTPS, and won't
  follow redirect requests to HTTP endpoints.

### discover(address, callback)

Gets link data for `address` and returns it to function `callback`.

If you've got an address and you don't want to bother figuring out if it's a 
webfinger or a hostname, call this and we'll do it for you.

`callback` works just like with `webfinger()`.

## Testing

The tests set up servers that listen on ports 80 and 443. On most
Unix-like systems, you have to be root to listen on ports below 1024 or whatever.

So, to run the unit tests, you have to go:

    sudo npm test

It's probably not a good idea to sudo any script without thinking
about it pretty hard. I suggest that if you're doing development, you
do it in a virtual machine so you're not sudo'ing dangerous stuff on
your main computer.
