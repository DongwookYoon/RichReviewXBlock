<h2>Assignment goal:</h2>

    We will use RichReview, an annotation tool, to create an engaging conversation over course material.
    We will use this activity like a press conference,
    where a lot of journalists come together to ask questions and comment on a particular story.
    RichReview will make reading and thinking about your own questions interactive.

    <b>Annotate:</b> Use the RichReview annotation tool to go back through the article.
    There will be 7-10 students in each annotation group.
